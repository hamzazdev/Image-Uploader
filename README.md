<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itxchh/Image-Uploader/master/demo.gif)

Check out my demo here: https://image-uploader.hamza.law/  

This was my first React project not following a tutorial which is something I am proud of. It was also my first tie deploying a Node.js app - I did this using DigitalOcean Droplets.

Even though this project is pretty simple, I feel like I have learnt a lot, from how to use the browser drag and clipboard APIs, to how to handle form data and process it server-side, to setting up a basic Droplet and configuring the server as well as setting up SSL using lets-encrypt and certbot.
